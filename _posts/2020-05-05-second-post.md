A national lab is turning to an AI machine the size of a dorm-room refrigerator to speed up the development of treatment and vaccines for coronavirus.

Argonne National Laboratory is using the CS-1 computer, from AI chip startup Cerebras Systems, to run learning models aimed at discovering compounds that can be used in existing or new drugs to help create a vaccine or treatments.

The system’s calling card is a massive chip, measuring 8.5 inches by 8.5 inches. Putting the neural network on the chip, instead of dispersing it across a system, enables problems to be solved faster. Data travels a shorter distance, speeding up the processing of information.

“You’ve got a chip that’s about 60 times bigger than any existing chip. That raw capability is what we’re trying to exploit,” said Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for computing, environment and life sciences at Argonne.
